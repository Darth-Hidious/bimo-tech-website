    content: `We are proud to announce that our SPARK project has been selected as a winner of the European Space Agency's FIRST! (Funding Innovation Research Science & Technology) Award.

The SPARK project focuses on developing Refractory High-Entropy Alloys (RHEAs) for next-generation space propulsion systems, addressing critical material challenges in extreme temperature environments.

## What are RHEAs?

Refractory High-Entropy Alloys represent a revolutionary class of metallic materials composed of five or more principal elements in near-equiatomic proportions. Unlike traditional alloys that rely on a single dominant element, RHEAs leverage the synergistic effects of multiple refractory elements (W, Mo, Ta, Nb, Re) to achieve unprecedented high-temperature performance.

## Project Goals

The SPARK project aims to:

- Develop novel RHEA compositions optimized for spacecraft propulsion applications
- Characterize mechanical behavior at temperatures exceeding 1500°C
- Demonstrate oxidation resistance in simulated space environments
- Validate manufacturing processes for complex geometries

## Looking Forward

This recognition from ESA validates our approach to advanced materials research and positions Bimo Tech at the forefront of space-grade material development. We're excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in extreme-environment materials.`,
